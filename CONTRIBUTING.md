Code contributions should start by branching off of master. In a nutshell:

1. Fork the repo if needed.
1. Create a branch off of master.
1. (Code code code...)
1. Run `sbt scalafmt`.
1. Run `sbt test`. Fix problems.
1. Submit a PR.

A pull request should include unit test coverage where appropriate, especially if it's a bug fix.
